# Charity_Blockchain_Project

People no longer trust charities because of the lack of openness in the transactions involving donations, which prevents donors from knowing whether their contributions are being used effectively.
Today, the Blockchain can be essential in helping to rebuild donor trust and advance the growth of global philanthropy. 
This technology can be used to strengthen the philanthropic system by eliminating incidents of fraud that harm beneficiaries, receivers, and donors, as well as to build a stronger network among the many philanthropic stakeholders to support humanitarian activities. 
This simple blockchain application aids in tracking donations and expenditures for charities. 
This will make it easier to track how and where every dollar is donated and spent.
